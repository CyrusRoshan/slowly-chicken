# Slowly, Chicken üêî

A simple boilerplate typescript project for Manifest V3 browser extensions, with a twist.

"Slowly, Chicken" slowly transforms all words in a webpage into "chicken", inspired in part by [this paper](https://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf) from Doug Zonker, and by the [Cageify extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cageify/ppoobnoipkllpmpnnldhpghefjhiinoh?hl=en).

"Slowly, Chicken" is listed [here on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slowly-chicken/aaoajbgembighfpplcgocpplkoinkjee?hl=en-US).
